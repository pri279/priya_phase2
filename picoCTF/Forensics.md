## Description
> Decode this message from the moon.

## Solution
The message.wav file was an audio file with SSTV encoding which I understood from the description that said the message was sent from the moon. On researching a little bit, I found an online decoder <https://sstv-decoder.mathieurenaud.fr/> using which I was able to decode the file into an image which contained the flag.

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{beep_boop_im_in_space}
```
## Concepts Learnt:
I learnt about SSTV (Slow-scan TV) and tools to decode an SSTV encoded file.
