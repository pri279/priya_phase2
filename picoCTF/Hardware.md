# 1. IQ Test

## Description
> let your input x = 30478191278.
wrap your answer with nite{ } for the flag.
As an example, entering x = 34359738368 gives (y0, ..., y11), so the flag would be nite{010000000011}.

## Solution
First I converted the given value of x=30478191278 into binary and got 11100011000101001000100101010101110. Since there are 36 inputs, I added a 0 to the starting of the number and got 011100011000101001000100101010101110. On solving the logic gates, I was able to retrieve the final output.
