## Solution
On launching the instance, I was able to access a menu driven program that asked me to choose a burger for a customer. It was mentioned that the customer, Patrick, wanted a giant bite. This meant that the option having format specifier %114d which meant an integer of size 114 would be resulted. This was the correct pick. For the second customer, SpongeBob wanted to "break the shop". Hence I picked the Cla%sic_Che%s%steak and it turned out to be the right option. 

```bash
pri279-picoctf@webshell:~$ nc mimas.picoctf.net 57603

Good job! Patrick is happy! Now can you serve the second customer?
Sponge Bob wants something outrageous that would break the shop (better be served quick before the shop owner kicks you out!)
