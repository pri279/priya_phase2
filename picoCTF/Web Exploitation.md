# 1. Web Gauntlet

***

# 2. SSTI1

## Description
> I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out! I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!

## Solution
On launching the instance, I was able to access a website that said it would announce whatever input I provide. 
The description talks about templating and the challenge's name is SSTI (which stands for Server Side Template Injection) so I found some resources that explained that Jinja2 was a common templating engine and was able to find a command to execute a shell command 'id', which is a Linux command used to return user info. 
```Jinja2
{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read()}}
```
With this knowledge, I tried using ls command to look for any further clues and found that there was a file call flag.
```Jinja2
{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read()}}
```

On using cat command, I was able to read the flag file and obtained the correct flag.
```Jinja2
{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read()}}
```

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_bdc95c1a}
```
## Concepts Learnt:
I learnt about templating engines such as jinja2 used for python based web apps, twig etc. and got an idea of how SSTI exploitations are carried out (RCE bypassing in this case)

## Notes:
I tried announcing various inputs and checked the Inspect tool but to no avail.

# 3. Cookies

## Description
> Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:17781/

## Solution
First I inputted "snickerdoodle" to see the output.

Then, I checked the Cookies tab under Application and saw that the value of the cookie was 0 and when I went back to Home, it changed to -1.
I tried searching up a list of cookie names like chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin etc. On inputting these and checking the value, it went from 1 to 2

This gave me a hint that the value was somehow related to the flag and by incrementing it by 2,3,4 etc upto 18, I was finally able to obtain the flag.

## Flag:
```picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_bb3b3535}```

## Concepts Learnt:
I learnt how cookies and it's values are correlated.
