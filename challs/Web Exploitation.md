# Temporal Token

## Description
> I made my own website with custom auth, but why can't i login with my credentials?

```
Username: Belegar
Password: Ironhammer
```

Directly access the challenge server at https://temporal-token.nitephase.live

## Solution
First I went to the website and tried to login with the credentials given and it showed:

The fact that it said token expired, I got the clue that the solution of the challenge was something related to the expiry of JWT tokens.
I checked the cookies and found a cookie named token and used <https://www.jwt.io/> to decode the token.

And saw exp set to zero which is Jan 01 1970, the Unix epoch. I used the same website to encode a new token and removed it sign by doing alg: "none" and exp: 9999999999
On modifying the value of the token cookie in the site, I was able to obtain the flag.
